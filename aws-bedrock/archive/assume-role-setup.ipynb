    "Okay, the error message clearly indicates that your IAM user (`arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:user/<username>`) does not have the necessary permissions to assume the IAM role (`arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/AmazonBedrockExecutionRoleForKnowledgeBase_c4h5j`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the problem and detailed steps to fix it:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding the Issue**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **IAM Roles and Permissions:** IAM roles are a secure way to grant permissions to AWS services and users. To assume a role, the user needs explicit permission.\n",
    "*   **`sts:AssumeRole` Permission:** The `sts:AssumeRole` action is what allows a principal (like your user) to assume a role and temporarily take on its permissions.\n",
    "*   **Missing Permission:** The error message means your `<user-name>` user's IAM policy doesn't include the permission to perform `sts:AssumeRole` on the target role.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Fix the Issue**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Identify the IAM User:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   You already have the IAM user ARN: `arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:user/<user-name>`.\n",
    "    *   Log in to the AWS Management Console as a user with sufficient permissions to modify IAM policies (usually an administrator).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Locate the User in IAM:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Navigate to the IAM service in the AWS console.\n",
    "    *   Go to \"Users\" and find the user named \"<user-name>\".\n",
    "    *   Click on the user to view its details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Check Existing Permissions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Go to the \"Permissions\" tab for the user.\n",
    "    *   Review the policies attached to the user (both directly and via groups).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Create or Modify a Policy:**\n",
    "    *   You have two options:\n",
    "        *   **Modify an existing policy**: if a policy already attached to the user contains the required access or can include it.\n",
    "        *   **Create a new policy:** This is preferred if you want to keep the roles separated or if there is no existing policy that can be adapted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Create a new policy (recommended)**\n",
    "\n",
    "        *   Go to \"Policies\" in the IAM service.\n",
    "        *   Click \"Create policy\".\n",
    "        *   Select the \"JSON\" tab.\n",
    "        *   Paste the following policy document, replacing `<Your-Role-ARN>` with the actual ARN of the role you need to assume.\n",
    "\n",
    "            ```json\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n",

    "                        \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n",

    "                    }\n",
    "                ]\n",
    "            }\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            For your case, replace `<Your-Role-ARN>` with  `arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/AmazonBedrockExecutionRoleForKnowledgeBase_c4h5j`\n",
    "\n",
    "            ```json\n",

    "                ]\n",
    "            }\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "        *   Click \"Next\".\n",
    "        *   Give the policy a meaningful name (e.g., `AllowAssumeBedrockRole`).\n",
    "        *   Click \"Create policy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Modify an existing policy (only if suitable):**\n",
    "         * Open the policy for editing.\n",
    "        * Add the following statement to the policy, replacing `<Your-Role-ARN>` with the actual ARN of the role you need to assume:\n",
    "        ```json\n",
    "         {\n",
    "              \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n",
    "               \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n",
    "                \"Resource\": \"<Your-Role-ARN>\"\n",
    "         }\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "       *  Click \"Review Policy\" then \"Save Changes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Attach the Policy to the User:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Go back to the \"<user-name>\" user's details.\n",
    "    *   Click \"Add permissions\" > \"Attach policies directly\".\n",
    "    *   Find the new policy you just created (e.g., `AllowAssumeBedrockRole`) using the filter.\n",
    "    *   Check the box next to the policy and click \"Add permissions\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Only grant the necessary permissions. If this user only needs to assume this specific role, don't grant broader permissions like `sts:*`.\n",
    "*   **Role's Trust Policy:**  Ensure the role (`arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/AmazonBedrockExecutionRoleForKnowledgeBase_c4h5j`) allows your user to assume it.  This policy is configured on the *role itself*. To review:\n",
    "    1.  Go to IAM, then \"Roles\"\n",
    "    2.  Search and click on the target role `AmazonBedrockExecutionRoleForKnowledgeBase_c4h5j`.\n",
    "    3.  Review the \"Trust relationships\" tab, it should contain a statement that allows you user,  `arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:user/<user-name>` to assume the role, it should resemble the following:\n",
    "        ```json\n",
    "        {\n",
    "          \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n",
    "          \"Statement\": [\n",
    "             {\n",
    "                \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n",
    "                \"Principal\": {\n",
    "                     \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:user/<user-name>\"\n",
    "                 },\n",
    "                 \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        If it doesn't, add this statement, using the \"Edit trust policy\" option on the role details page.\n",
    "*   **Policy Propagation:** It can sometimes take a few moments for IAM policy changes to propagate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Updated Code (No Code Change Needed):**\n",
    "\n",
    "The code you provided is correct *once the IAM permissions are in place*. You **do not** need to modify your Python code; the only change is to grant the required permissions in AWS IAM.\n",

Follow these steps in the AWS console, and you should resolve the error without any code changes. If you continue to have issue please check both the user's policy and the role's trust policy.\n"
