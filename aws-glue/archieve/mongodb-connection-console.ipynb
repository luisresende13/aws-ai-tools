    "To connect AWS Glue with MongoDB, you can follow these steps to configure the connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites:\n",
    "1. **MongoDB Cluster**: Ensure you have a running MongoDB instance (either on-premises, in the cloud, or MongoDB Atlas).\n",
    "2. **AWS Glue Service**: You need access to AWS Glue and the necessary permissions to create resources such as connections, crawlers, jobs, etc.\n",
    "3. **MongoDB JDBC Driver**: You will need the appropriate MongoDB JDBC driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Connect AWS Glue to MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Set Up MongoDB JDBC Connection**\n",
    "   AWS Glue supports connecting to MongoDB via the MongoDB JDBC driver. To use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Download the MongoDB JDBC Driver**: Download the MongoDB JDBC driver (such as `mongodb-driver-<version>.jar`).\n",
    "   - **Upload JDBC Driver to AWS S3**:\n",
    "     - Go to your AWS S3 bucket.\n",
    "     - Create a folder (e.g., `glue-jdbc-drivers`).\n",
    "     - Upload the MongoDB JDBC driver (JAR file) to this folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Create a Connection in AWS Glue**\n",
    "   - Open the **AWS Glue Console**.\n",
    "   - Navigate to **Connections** under the Data Catalog section.\n",
    "   - Click on **Add connection**.\n",
    "   - Select **JDBC** as the connection type.\n",
    "   - Provide a name for the connection, such as `mongodb-connection`.\n",
    "   - Set the connection properties as follows:\n",
    "     - **Connection URL**: The URL to your MongoDB instance. For MongoDB Atlas, it should look like this:\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       jdbc:mongodb://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<database>\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       Example for MongoDB Atlas:\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       jdbc:mongodb://user:password@cluster0-shard-00-00.abcd.mongodb.net:27017/mydb?retryWrites=true&w=majority\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "     - **Driver Class Name**: The fully qualified class name for MongoDB JDBC driver, usually `mongodb.jdbc.MongoDriver`.\n",
    "     - **JDBC Driver JAR Location**: Provide the S3 path to the JDBC driver JAR file you uploaded earlier. For example:\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       s3://<your-bucket-name>/glue-jdbc-drivers/mongodb-driver-<version>.jar\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Once done, click **Next** and follow the prompts to create the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Create a Glue Crawler**\n",
    "   After you set up the connection, create a Glue crawler to detect the schema of the MongoDB collection:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Go to **Crawlers** in the AWS Glue Console.\n",
    "   - Click **Add crawler** and provide a name.\n",
    "   - Set the data store to **JDBC**.\n",
    "   - Choose the **MongoDB connection** created earlier.\n",
    "   - Set the database and collection names that you want to crawl.\n",
    "   - Choose an output database in AWS Glue for the schema.\n",
    "   - Schedule the crawler if needed, and click **Run** to start the crawling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Create a Glue ETL Job**\n",
    "   Once the schema is available in AWS Glue Data Catalog, you can create a Glue ETL job:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Go to **Jobs** in the AWS Glue Console.\n",
    "   - Click **Add job** and provide a name.\n",
    "   - Choose an IAM role with appropriate permissions.\n",
    "   - Select the **Source** as your MongoDB Data Catalog table.\n",
    "   - Select the **Target** as your desired data destination (e.g., Amazon S3, Redshift, etc.).\n",
    "   - Write the ETL script, or use the visual editor to transform and load data.\n",
    "   - Once your job script is ready, click **Run** to start the ETL job.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Access Data in MongoDB**\n",
    "   After the job runs successfully, the data from MongoDB will be available in the specified target, like an S3 bucket or a data warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Glue Script for MongoDB ETL (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s an example of an ETL script you could use in AWS Glue to read data from MongoDB and load it into S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "from pyspark.context import SparkContext\n",
    "from pyspark.sql.context import SQLContext\n",
    "from awsglue.context import GlueContext\n",
    "from awsglue.dynamicframe import DynamicFrame\n",
    "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize GlueContext\n",
    "sc = SparkContext()\n",
    "sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)\n",
    "glueContext = GlueContext(sc)\n",
    "spark = glueContext.spark_session\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a Glue DynamicFrame from MongoDB\n",
    "mongodb_options = {\n",
    "    \"uri\": \"mongodb://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<database>\",\n",
    "    \"database\": \"<database_name>\",\n",
    "    \"collection\": \"<collection_name>\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load data from MongoDB into DynamicFrame\n",
    "mongo_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(\n",
    "    connection_type=\"mongo\",\n",
    "    connection_options=mongodb_options\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert DynamicFrame to DataFrame for processing\n",
    "df = mongo_df.toDF()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform some transformations (example)\n",
    "df_transformed = df.select(\"field1\", \"field2\", \"field3\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert DataFrame back to DynamicFrame\n",
    "dynamic_frame_transformed = DynamicFrame.fromDF(df_transformed, glueContext, \"dynamic_frame_transformed\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write the data to S3\n",
    "output_path = \"s3://your-output-bucket/output-folder/\"\n",
    "glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_options(\n",
    "    dynamic_frame_transformed,\n",
    "    connection_type=\"s3\",\n",
    "    connection_options={\"path\": output_path},\n",
    "    format=\"parquet\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "This process involves setting up a JDBC connection to MongoDB, using AWS Glue crawlers to detect the schema, and creating ETL jobs to transform and load data into a destination like S3. The integration makes it seamless to process MongoDB data at scale using Glue's powerful ETL capabilities."
