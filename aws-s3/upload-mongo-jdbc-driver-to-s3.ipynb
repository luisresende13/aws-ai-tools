    "If you don't have an S3 bucket yet, you can create one using the AWS CLI or via the AWS Management Console. Below are the steps to create a new S3 bucket and upload the JDBC driver:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 0: Download MongoDB JDBC Driver:\n",
    "\n",
    "Available at: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/odbc-driver\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using AWS CLI**:\n",
    "To create a new S3 bucket using the AWS CLI, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "aws s3 mb s3://your-bucket-name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replace `your-bucket-name` with the name you want for your S3 bucket.\n",
    "- **Bucket Name Rules**:\n",
    "  - Must be globally unique.\n",
    "  - Can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and periods.\n",
    "  - Cannot start or end with a hyphen or period.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "aws s3 mb s3://my-glue-jdbc-bucket\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command creates a new bucket named `my-glue-jdbc-bucket` in your default AWS region.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Via AWS Management Console**:\n",
    "1. Go to the [Amazon S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3).\n",
    "2. Click **Create bucket**.\n",
    "3. Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., `my-glue-jdbc-bucket`).\n",
    "4. Choose a region for your bucket (you can keep the default).\n",
    "5. Leave the other settings as default and click **Create**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Upload the JDBC Driver to S3\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the bucket is created, you can upload the JDBC driver to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using AWS CLI**:\n",
    "To upload the JDBC driver, use the `aws s3 cp` command as mentioned before.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "aws s3 cp mongodb-jdbc-2.2.1-all.jar s3://my-glue-jdbc-bucket/glue-jdbc-drivers/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will upload the `mongodb-jdbc-2.2.1-all.jar` file to the `glue-jdbc-drivers/` directory inside your S3 bucket `my-glue-jdbc-bucket`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Via AWS Management Console**:\n",
    "1. Open the [S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3).\n",
    "2. Select your newly created bucket.\n",
    "3. Click **Upload**.\n",
    "4. Choose **Add files**, then select the `mongodb-jdbc-2.2.1-all.jar` file from your local machine.\n",
    "5. Click **Upload**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Verify the Upload\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify the upload, you can either:\n",
    "- Check the contents of your S3 bucket from the **S3 Console**.\n",
    "- Use the AWS CLI to list the files in your bucket:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  aws s3 ls s3://my-glue-jdbc-bucket/glue-jdbc-drivers/\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've uploaded the JDBC driver to the S3 bucket, you can reference it in AWS Glue as described earlier."
